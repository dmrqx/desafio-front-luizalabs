## Tools

This repository makes use of:

* [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for bootstraping a React application
* [ViaCEP api](https://viacep.com.br/) for querying zipcodes from Brazil
* [Nominatim api](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim) for reverse geocoding physical addresses
* [React-Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) as an abstraction layer for working with open-source JavaScript library [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) on React


## Getting started

As of development, simply run the following command to see it in action:


```
npm install && npm start
```

## Tests

Unit tests were implemented using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)


```
npm test
```


## Next steps

> **Note:** _No app is ever perfect, but one must strive for excellence. Stay tuned._ :sweat_smile:

- Handle address not found
- Handle empty form submit
- Style error messages
