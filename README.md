# Front-End challenge
### React App for querying ZipCodes (pt-br)
A Single Page Application, built with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/).

---

## Tools

This repository makes use of:

* [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for bootstraping a React application
* [ViaCEP api](https://viacep.com.br/) for querying zipcodes from Brazil


## Getting started

As of development, simply run the following command to see it in action:


```
npm start
```


## Next steps

> **Note:** _Still a lot to cover. Stay tuned. :sweat_smile:_

- Provide map tile of found address. _Planning on using open-source JS library [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) for map rendering_.
- Organize code into components
- Implement layout
